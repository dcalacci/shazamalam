Once the tar.gz has been unzipped, navigate to the 
directory containing its contents and run this 
command to create the executable:

> chmod +x dan

After that ./dan should be available from this
directory as defined at:

http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs4500f14/assignment5.txt

The only third party software used is the LAME
encoder, the standard linux ‘file’ command and
the standard python libraries found on the 
CCIS Linux machines
