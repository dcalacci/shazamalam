TEAM ZERO's killer code for finding copyrighted audio.

it takes two directories, a directory of original audio files, and a
directory of audio files that may have used pieces from files in the
first directory. The output is a list of potential matches, and the
start time of those matches in the audio files that use the original
audio.

For a summary of our strategy, check out `notebooks/fingerprinting.ipynb`

We do a nasty spectral analysis of the audio files, creating sick
audio fingerprints that consist of rad pairs of peak
frequencies. Check it out.
